# messaging-redis #

A simple contrived example of how to connect to Redis and send and receive
messages.  I would've been more interested in a tutorial on how to move
sessions to Redis and use it as a key-value store.  Never seen Redis
used for messaging though, so there is that.   

No tests.  And while they could've included a docker-compose file for Redis
instead of requiring an install, they didn't.  I like the 
messaging-rabbitmq tutorial more.
